# Find Bad Motion Tracks

This is a [Blender](https://blender.org)
[addon](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html)
for finding bad [motion tracking
tracks](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/movie_clip/tracking/clip/editing/track.html).

The way it works is that it highlights tracks that move differently from the
others.

Basically, if all tracks move to the right, except one that moves to the left,
then the single track moving to the left is likely wrong and should be evaluated
by a human.

## Installation Instructions

FIXME: None yet, half of the UI is still in the Blender console, that needs to
be fixed before I feel comfortable trying to get anybody but me to use this.

## Usage Instructions

1. Make sure the addon is enabled, I'm using the VS Code Blender extension for
   this right now (FIXME: This is sucky advise)
1. Do some motion tracking, collect some tracks
1. In the Motion Tracking workspace, Movie Clip Editor on the middle left of
   your screen, select the Track tab, expand "Find Bad Tracks" (you may have to
   scroll down to see this section) and press the "Find Bad Tracks" button
1. A list of tracks will now be displayed just below that button, with the worst
   frame number for each track and its badness score at that point.
1. Clicking a track in the list will select that track in the clip editor and
   take you to the worst frame. Stepping a frame left will show how the track
   skips / slides.

# Comparison to Built-in Functionality

Find Bad Tracks is similar to the built-in [Filter
Tracks](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/movie_clip/tracking/clip/editing/track.html#filter-tracks)
functionality ([source](https://github.com/blender/blender/blob/04c75c5ce7699a1502a7c2212d4aa57166465514/release/scripts/startup/bl_operators/clip.py#L141-L215)).

## Development

I have developed this with:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with its [Blender Development
  extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development)
- The [Fake Blender Python API module collection](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module) in a virtualenv
- Blender 2.93.1

## Making a New Release

Run `release.sh` and follow instructions.

## TODO

- Document install instructions higher up in this document
- Announce on BlenderNation
- Fix user reported issues
- Publish on Blender Market
- Profile and see what can easily be sped up
- Fix the tracks list tooltip, the current text makes no sense: "Active Bad
  Track / Double click to rename."
- Ignore locked tracks, assuming they have been manually vetted?
- Add a `tox.ini` with:
  - `mypy` after <https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module/issues/92> gets fixed
  - `pylint`
  - `black` code formatting, format locally and verify in CI
- Add a `tox` Github action for PRs and pushes

### DONE

- Document a release process
- Make an initial release
